TIP: If you wish to maintain your core images as cores get updated, simply install you core updates as normal but don't select the "Platforms" folder as you drag across the update files. This folder only contains the text and image data for the menu so wont inhibit the working of the core, it will just stop you from overwriting your images and save you from having to reinstall them each time.
